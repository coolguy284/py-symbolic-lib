main items:
tidy up imports
default to string function should have params for multiplication_compact, addition_compact, defaulting to false, exponential compact defaulting to true; to string compact just calls default to string with all args set to true
to string latex should treat characters in a variable name after the first as subscript, except for special variables that are a function that have a latex escape (like sin, cos, ln)
add substitute function, as function for each class, to substitute a variable for something else
add relational operators
add function calls
if multiplicative group only has single letter variables and other stuff, dont put * between characters (this is an optional parameter defaulting to true) (do this on at least the latex string representation)
  but still put * symbol before a function call if doing so
add sqrt object, nthroot object (and simplification rule to convert to sqrt if n=2), function call object
  add special variables variable type, for variables with a behavior attached (like hyperreal numbers, sin, cos, ln, i, etc.)
  add d/dx, integral, limit, summation, productation objects
unary plus minus obj
many solutions object, ie x=2 and x=6 (basically an and group)
factor simplification or distribution simplification
  prime factor simplification option to be even more factorized

low priority:
convert most star imports to more specific
add proper annotated types
remove check for required methods if debug mode not on
clean up class creation functions
