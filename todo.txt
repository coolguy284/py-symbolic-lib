main items:
make the from_ methods memoized as well, using a raw creation version
textual representation for additive group should automatically put a minus instead of a plus if the element is a unary minus, but make this behavior an optional argument defaulting to true
add substitute function, as function for each class, to substitute a variable for something else
add relational operators
add function calls
if multiplicative group only has single letter variables and other stuff, dont put * between characters (this is an optional parameter defaulting to true) (do this on at least the latex string representation)
  but still put * symbol before a function call if doing so
unary plus minus obj
many solutions object, ie x=2 and x=6 (basically an and group)

low priority:
convert most star imports to more specific
add proper annotated types
remove check for required methods if debug mode not on
